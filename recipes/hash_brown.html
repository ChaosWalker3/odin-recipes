    <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
    <h3>Hash Browns are a popular breakfast dish in America.</h3>
    <p>It is made of finely-julienned or shredded potatoes that are fried until golden brown.</p>

    <!-- INGREDIENTS LIST -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lbs Russett potatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Potato starch or Cornstarch</li>
        <li>Olive oil or any high-heat oil to fry</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- COOKING STEPS -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into chunks.</li>
        <li>Put the potato chunks into a boiling pot of water. Wait for 15 minutes or so.</li>
        <li>Check if soft enough to easily cut through but not so much that it is mushy.</li>
        <li>When done, drain the water and move the potatoes on to a cutting board. Let it cool slightly for around 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut them or julienne into little bits.</li>
        <li>Put them into a bowl and put in the starch and then season to taste with salt and pepper, but only halfway. Shape them into patty-like structures.</li>
        <li>Heat up a large frying pan and put enough oil to cover the patties. When oil is hot, add the potato patties, enough at a time.</li>
        <li>Cook for 1-2 minutes. If the patties brown quickly, reduce heat.</li>
        <li>When patties are golden brown, move to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil. Sprinkle the other half of seasonings immediately.</li>
        <li>Serve.</li>
    </ol>
