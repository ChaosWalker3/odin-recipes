    <!-- INGREDIENTS LIST -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs Pork chops</li>
        <li>1/2 All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon Salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tablespoon Pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon Paprika</li>
        <li>3 large Eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Olive oil or any high-heat oil to saute</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- COOKING STEPS -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare three bowls. In the first, beat the eggs along with the paprika. In the second bowl, put in the flour and mix with the salt and pepper. And in the third, Put in the breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Place the pork chops on a flat surface. Pound until they are of 1/4 thickness. You may use 2 plastic wraps and put the pork chops in between them to help.</li>
        <li>Dip the cutlets in the flour. Make sure they are fully coated. Shake off excess.</li>
        <li>Dip them next into the eggs. Let the excess drip off before continuing.</li>
        <li>Coat them in the breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Heat a large non-stick pan and add enough oil to cover the whole bottom of it. Once the oil is hot, place the coated cutlets, but only few at a time.</li>
        <li>Saute each side around 4-5 minutes at a time. If the cutlets brown too quickly, reduce the heat.</li>
        <li>Move to a plate lined with paper towels when done to absorb the excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve with the lemon wedges when ready.</li>
    </ol>
